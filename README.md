## Game Desciption
Ultimate/Strategic Tic-Tac-Toe is a board game composed of nine tic-tac-toe
boards arranged in a 3-by-3 grid. Players take turns playing in the
smaller tic-tac-toe boards until one of them wins in the larger tic-tac-toe
board. Compared to traditional tic-tac-toe, strategy in this game is conceptually more difficult, and has proven more challenging for
computers. For more details, click [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultimate_tic-tac-toe).



## GUI
The game has been developed in the Racket programming language. 
We have used the 2htdp/universe and 2htdp/image libraries to
implement the GUI of our game. The GUI includes a 9 set of 3x3 boards
and the individual boards are coloured depicting who has won that board
and the board on which the move has to played is coloured yellow.

## AI for single player mode
For making the AI in single player mode, we have implemented the
<b>Monte-Carlo Tree Search</b> algorithm to generate partial branches of the
game tree. The Monte Carlo tree-search relies on random simulations of
games in order to determine how good a position is. The tree has been
constructed using a general node structure and each node is a state in
which the game can be and it's kids are a list of possible states that can
be generated by playing any move on the current state. When the
computer has to finally play a move, it applies the UCT formula on each
branch to find the best move available.
The UCT formula used is -

where

- <i>w</i><sub>i</sub> stands for the number of wins for the node considered after the i-th move
- <i>n</i><sub>i</sub> stands for the number of simulations for the node considered after the i-th move
- <i>N</i><sub>i</sub> stands for the total number of simulations after the i-th move run by the parent node of the one considered
- <i>c</i> is the exploration parameter—theoretically equal to √2; in practice usually chosen empirically

## Limitations
For the one-player version, the AI is not as efficient as one would like it
to be. We couldn’t keep the depth of the tree search sufficient enough as it lead to a substantial increase in the computation
time. Next step would be to train the AI beforehand and save it instead of running hundreds of simulations during the game. <br/>
The game tree has been constructed using purely random simulations to
decide whether a given move is favourable or not. We were not able to
design heuristics for the game, which would have increased the
efficiency of decision-making, due to the complexity of the game.
